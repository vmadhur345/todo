# Backend Setup and Workflow Documentation

## Overview
This project implements a backend service for managing a simple to-do list application. It includes CRUD operations for tasks and utilizes JWT-based authentication for secure access to API endpoints. Below, you will find instructions for setting up and running the backend, as well as an explanation of the workflow.

## Features
- **Task Management:** CRUD operations for tasks (create, read, update, delete).
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure access to API endpoints using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Database Integration:** Persistent storage using MongoDB Atlas.

---

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the backend, ensure that you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14 or above)
- **npm** (v6 or above)
- **Git**

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Start the Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The backend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
1. **POST /auth/register**
   - Register a new user.
   - Body:
     ```json
     {
       "username": "string",
       "password": "string"
     }
     ```

2. **POST /auth/login**
   - Authenticate a user and return a JWT token.
   - Body:
     ```json
     {
       "username": "string",
       "password": "string"
     }
     ```

### Task Management (Protected)
1. **POST /tasks**
   - Create a new task.
   - Headers:
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token>
     ```
   - Body:
     ```json
     {
       "title": "string",
       "description": "string",
       "status": "string" (default: "pending")
     }
     ```

2. **GET /tasks**
   - Fetch all tasks.
   - Headers:
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token>
     ```

3. **GET /tasks/:id**
   - Fetch a task by its ID.
   - Headers:
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token>
     ```

4. **PUT /tasks/:id**
   - Update a task's status.
   - Headers:
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token>
     ```
   - Body:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "string" (e.g., "in-progress", "completed")
     }
     ```

5. **DELETE /tasks/:id**
   - Delete a task by its ID.
   - Headers:
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token>
     ```

## JWT-Based Authentication

### Workflow
1. **User Registration:** Users register with a username and password. The password is hashed and stored securely in the database.
2. **Login:** Users log in with their credentials to receive a JWT token.
3. **Token Validation:** For protected routes, the JWT token must be sent in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.
4. **Access Control:** The token is validated for authenticity and expiration before granting access to the resource.

### Implementation
- **Middleware:** A custom middleware ensures that the JWT token is present and valid for protected routes.
- **Token Generation:** JWT tokens are generated using the `jsonwebtoken` library.
- **Hashing:** Passwords are hashed using `bcrypt` for secure storage.

---

## Development and Testing

### Development
- Run the server in development mode:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  This uses `nodemon` for live reloading during development.

### Testing
- Use a tool like **Postman** or **cURL** to test API endpoints.
- Run unit tests (if implemented):
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
